**Hello there, profile viewer! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a 17 y/o student who writes code in their spare time. Here's some of the projects I have worked on:

- i386chat (https://github.com/i386chat), a centralised chat server that authenticates via. tokens instead of emails and passwords and does not log user activity.
- Sonnet (https://github.com/SonnetDiscord), a Discord bot written in Python for moderation and server administration amongst other features.
- Rhea (many repositories, all on my Profile), prequel to Sonnet written in JavaScript - being phased out in favour for Sonnet soon.

Enjoy browsing my Profile - bear in mind that what I've listed above is not *every* project I've ever worked on, so you might find some in my repositories list that I haven't mentioned.
